A new Flutter project.

The Creeper is one of the most iconic and recognizable creatures in the world of Minecraft. It's a green, almost reptilian creature with a unique appearance characterized by its pixelated design. What makes Creepers particularly notorious is their explosive nature. They silently approach players and explode when they get close, causing significant damage to both the player and the surrounding environment.

Creepers are known for their hissing sound, which is a warning sign to players that they are nearby. Because of their stealthy approach and explosive potential, they often catch players off guard, leading to surprise attacks and sometimes the destruction of valuable structures.
